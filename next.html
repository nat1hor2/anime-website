                <h2>Hunter x Hunter</h3>
                    <p>Hunter x Hunter is about a boy, Gon, who wants to become a hunter
                        because his dad left him to become one. 
                        Gon tries to find his dad and runs into
                        several adventures while training and stuff. 
                        Gon reminds me a lot of Naruto because
                        he has incredible percistence and self dicipline. Would definetly recommend.

                <h2>Attack on Titan</h2>
                <p>In this world, the human race has almost gone extinct when for some unknown reason
                    titans appear and try to devour all humans. What little is left of the human race
                    now lives inside three walls. One fateful day after hundreds of years of peace 
                    there is a titan attack and the outer wall has to be abandoned. After this attack
                    the protagonist Eren's resolve to join the Survey Corps which is an elite 
                    military organisation dedicated to exploring the area outside of the walls and
                    trying to fight against the titans. This is a must watch

                <h2>Naruto</h2>
                <p>Naruto is an orphan who's parents died when the Nine Tailed Fox 
                    atacked the Village Hidden in the Leaves. The monster was huge, and the fourth Hokage                    
                    (the ruler and strongest Ninja) sacrificed himself to defeat the monster. Even
                    then, they couldn't kill it, but they sealed it inside Naruto, still a baby at this 
                    time. Even though Naruto has done nothing wrong, everyone hates him like a monster.
                    Although Naruto is shattered because of how people treat him, he decides only to 
                    train harder because of this. If you watch anime, this is something you have
                    to see.

                <h2>One Punch Man</h2>
                <p>The protagonist of this story, Saitama starts off as a completely normal human
                    being, and just got fired from his office job. As he is walking back home after
                    job hunting, he encounters a crab-monster trying
                    to kill a child (monsters are a common occurence
                    in this world). Saitama just barely defeats this monster, but after this day he 
                    decides to become a hero. He trains incredibly hard and in just three years he becomes
                    an unbeliveably strong superhero. Saitama meets Genos, who wants to become Saitama's 
                    diciple after fighting him and losing miserably. Together they go through many
                    adventures, and become stronger together. Would definetly recommend, is kinda comedic
